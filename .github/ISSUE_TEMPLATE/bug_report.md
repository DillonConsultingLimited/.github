**Problem**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. What is the expected behaviour? How does it get triggered? A user story format is acceptable.

**Functional requirement**

Identify the defective resources (objects, functions); describe their defects and ways to fix this

**Screenshots**

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Timelines, deployment checklist**

When did this defect start, and how much data has it impacted? Can the fix be deployed during working hours? Are there impacts to existing apps/data that we maintain? Do you need to break deployment to stages? Are there any regression considerations? Are there existing objects that may need to be changed?

**Acceptance Criteria**

How are you testing this fix? Does it do anything more than fix the original problem?
